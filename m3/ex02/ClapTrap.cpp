/*
Clarification of Each Concept:
Hit Points (_hitPoints):

What it does: Tracks how much health or life the ClapTrap has.
Impact of attack: Decreases when ClapTrap takes damage.
Cannot perform actions if hitPoints == 0.
Attack Damage (_attackDamage):

What it does: Defines how much damage the ClapTrap inflicts on another object when it attacks.
Impact of attack: Reduces the target's hit points by this amount when attacking.
Does not affect ClapTrap's own health.
Energy Points (_energyPoints):

What it does: Tracks the energy ClapTrap needs to perform actions (attack/repair).
Impact of attack/repair: Each action costs 1 energy point.
Cannot perform actions if energyPoints == 0.
